# Front-End Project

### This was my first project for my bootcamp at Tera.

Programming Languages:
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap

## Basic Info
The ideia came from my friends and I. We all work with cocktails and mixology here in Brazil and we always thought that drinks were a restricted world for those who can afford.
But we want to expand to people who either don't know how and what to drink. There are classic and simple drinks that can be bottled and selled to anyone there are insterested in.
That way you can get a taste of the world most famous drinks carefully prepared by professionals with years of experience and prize winners.

## Development

As my first project it was a huge challenge. Started with pure HTML, just writing everything that I wanted on the main page. I wanted it to be simple, like my teachers advised me.
My focus was all about the code, not the design. The next step was stylize so everything could be where I wanted. I had a struggle when dealing with responsive with just CSS.
At first it was perfect on a desktop Full HD screen, but at a smaller screen like smartphones the images got broken. Work all around the smartphone screen and I got a
desktop application broken. The way that I found to solve those problems was using Bootstrap. Bootstrap's classes helped me to get everything in place and now it is 
responsive at any size of screens.

## On the main page you can se a brief description about the store, a carousel that shows a photo of each drink offerted and a navigation bar. </br>

## Every photo and drink's name is a link to the page that has a description of each one, with a button of purchase. </br>
